## About

The Landscape Crop Assessment Survey (LCAS) is a tool designed to collect and analyze data on agricultural production constraints, including droughts, floods, pests, diseases, and other factors affecting crop yields.

## Modules

Our modular system contains specialized components for different aspects of crop assessment:

1. [Production Constraints Module](modules/production-constraints.md) - Key constraints like droughts and floods
2. [Yield Assessment Module](modules/yield-assessment.md) - Crop productivity metrics
3. [Soil Quality Module](modules/soil-quality.md) - Soil characteristics analysis
... (add more modules)

### Featured Module: Production Constraints

This module documents key production constraints including:
- Drought stress assessment
- Flood impact analysis
- Pest and disease monitoring
